Task: For bignum+, you must find a recurrence that the operation-counting function satisfies (when the two numbers being added have the same number, n, of digits), and then state whether the solution to this recurrence is (a) at-most-linear, (b) at-most-quadratic, or (c) possibly worse than quadratic.

Let A(n) be the largest number of elementary operations involved in applying bignum+ to any two operands of exactly n digits each. 

Because the recursion is being done in the helper function "helper", the number of elementary operations in A(n) depends on that of H(n).

Let H(n) be the largest number of elementary operations involved in applying helper to any two operands of exactly n digits each. 
All the 
H(0) = a
H(1) = b
H(2) <= c + H(1) = c + b
H(3) <= c + H(2) = c + c + b
H(n) <= c + H(n - 1) 
…
For n>0,
H(n) <= (n-1)c + b = nc - c + b = nc + d
The helper function runs in at-most-linear time, so bignum+ also runs in at-most-linear time. 


Task: For bignum*, you need only derive the recurrence (this time for the more general case where one argument has length n, and the other has length k, so that the operation-counting function has two arguments, n and k, but need not solve it. The details for each of these are presented below.


Let P(n) be the largest number of elementary operations involved in applying s-mult to any two bignums, each of length no greater than n digits.
P(0) = g
P(1) <= h + P(0) = h + g
P(2) <= h + P(1) = h + h + g
P(n) <= h + P(n-1)
…
For n>0,
P(n) <= nh + g
The s-mult function is at most linear. 

Let B(n) be the largest number of elementary operations involved in applying bignum+ to any two bignums, each of length no greater than n digits (this is not the same as A(n) above).
B(0) = i
B(1) = j
B(2) <= k + B(1) = k + j
B(n) <= (n-1)k + j
This is at most linear. 

Let M(n, k) be the largest number of elementary operations required to apply bignum* procedure to a bignum of length n and a bignum of length k.
M(n, k) ≤ q if n = k = 0
M(n, k) ≤ q if n = 0, k > 0
M(n, k) ≤ r if n > 0, k = 0
M(n, k) ≤ s + B(n+k) + P(n) + t + M(n, k-1) if otherwise
Bignum* is at most quadratic.
